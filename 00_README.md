# DS / ML / AI Playbook

## Overview

This repository is a **living playbook** covering core foundations and advanced topics across:

- Data Science
- Machine Learning Engineering
- AI Engineering

It is designed to serve multiple purposes:
- On-the-job reference material
- Personal learning and system design reinforcement
- A structured knowledge base suitable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

## How This Playbook Was Created

The **structure and organization** of this playbook were **AI-assisted**.

Specifically:
- Folder layout
- Topic taxonomy
- Ordering and progression of concepts
- Separation between foundations, systems, and applied pipelines

These elements were generated collaboratively with AI to ensure:
- Coverage completeness
- Logical progression
- Industry-aligned mental models

---

## Content Authorship & Responsibility

All **technical content**, including:
- Explanations
- Code examples
- Design tradeoffs
- Failure modes
- Heuristics
- Interview framing
- Commentary and conclusions

has been **human-generated, curated, edited, and validated**.

AI was used as an accelerator for:
- Drafting
- Refactoring
- Consistency checks
- Expanding examples

However, **final judgment, correctness, and intent are entirely human-owned**.

---

## Work in Progress

This repository is intentionally marked as **work in progress**.

You should expect:
- Iterative refinement
- Topic expansion
- Reorganization as understanding deepens
- Promotion of material from private notes into public reference
- Occasional restructuring as industry practices evolve

Nothing here should be interpreted as:
- Static
- Exhaustive
- Official guidance

Instead, treat this playbook as:
> A continuously improving professional knowledge system.

---

## Scope & Intent

This repository prioritizes:
- Practical system thinking over academic formality
- Real-world tradeoffs over idealized solutions
- Decision-making frameworks over rote memorization

Where appropriate, content reflects:
- FinTech / Credit Risk experience
- Large-scale production systems
- Experimentation-driven decision making
- Principal-level ownership expectations

---

## License & Usage

Please do not interpret any content as:
- Legal advice
- Compliance guidance
- Production-ready defaults without context

## Final Note

If you are reading this as a reviewer, interviewer, or collaborator:

This playbook is not meant to demonstrate *perfection* —  
it is meant to demonstrate **how an experienced practitioner thinks, learns, and builds systems over time**.
